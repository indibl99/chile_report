Hi Professor Lira!
Thank you so much again for everything you’ve done for me, I had an incredible time here in Chile and a lot of that was because of how great it was working with you.

These are all the python scripts I wrote. The most important ones are:
auto_final.py (the pipeline)
total_BPT.py (the code for displaying the cumulative BPT results)
rename_ids.py (to convert between my naming system and Jorge’s)
testing_stacking.py (the stacking code, for this to work, you need to manually change the guess for the broad-line gaussian component, and you need to make a directory in /Users/plira/india_temp/variable_spectra/auto/stacking with all the spectra you want to stack)

There are a lot of comments in the codes themselves, so that should help as well.
